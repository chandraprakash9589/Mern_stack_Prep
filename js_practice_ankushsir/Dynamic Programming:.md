Dynamic Programming:

Coin Change:
Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.
Input:
const coins = [1, 2, 5];
const amount = 11;
Output:
3

Longest Common Subsequence:

Input:
const text1 = 'abcde';
const text2 = 'ace';
Output:
3

Fibonacci Sequence:
Find the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming.
Input:
const n = 10;
Output:
55

Knapsack Problem:
Given a set of items with weights and values, find the maximum value that can be obtained with a given weight capacity.
Input:
const weights = [2, 2, 6, 5, 4];
const values = [6, 3, 5, 4, 6];
const capacity = 10;
Output:
15
