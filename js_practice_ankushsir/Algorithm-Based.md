Algorithm-Based:

Two Sum:
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target sum.
Input:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
Output:
[0, 1]

Maximum Subarray Sum:
Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in an array.
Input:
const nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4];
Output:
6

Longest Increasing Subsequence:
Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
Input:
const nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18];
Output:
5

Merge Intervals:
Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.
Input:
const intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]];
Output:
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
