Asynchronous Operations:
This question would typically involve handling asynchronous operations, so there's no specific sample input and output.

Data Structures:
The input and output would depend on the specific data structure you're asked to implement, such as adding and removing elements from a stack or queue.

Algorithmic Problems:
The input and output would depend on the specific algorithmic problem you're asked to solve. For example, in a "two-sum" problem, the input would be an array and a target sum, and the output would be the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
